1. What is the difference between padding and margin in CSS?

Imagine every element on your webpage as a box. The padding is like the soft cushion inside the box—it’s the space between the content (like text or an image) and the element’s border. This extra space makes the content feel less cramped and more readable. On the flip side, margin is the space outside the box’s border, separating one element from another. If you want to give your elements room to breathe and not crowd each other, you adjust the margin. So, in short: padding is inside the border, margin is outside

2. How does font-family influence the look of a webpage?

The font-family property is like the voice of your website—it sets the tone and personality. Choosing a font isn’t just about style; it shapes how visitors feel and interact with your content. For example, a bold, modern font can make your site feel strong and confident, while a script font might add elegance. The right font makes your content easy to read and helps users connect emotionally with your brand. On the other hand, a poor font choice can make your site look unprofessional or even drive visitors away. Good typography isn’t just pretty; it’s essential for readability, accessibility, and building trust with your audience.

3. Why is it important to specify a background-color for elements in web design?

Background color does more than just add a splash of color—it’s a key player in readability and user comfort. The right background color can make your text pop, reduce eye strain, and guide users’ attention to important areas. It also sets the mood: calming tones for reading, vibrant hues for excitement. Importantly, background color choices affect accessibility. High contrast between text and background ensures everyone, including those with visual impairments, can read your content easily. In short, background color is both a creative and practical tool for making your site welcoming and inclusive.

4. How did the background-image property change the visual appeal of your webpage?

Adding a background-image is like hanging art on a blank wall—it instantly transforms the space. Suddenly, your webpage isn’t just functional; it’s expressive. A well-chosen background image can set the mood, tell a story, or highlight key sections. It adds depth and personality, breaking up the monotony of solid colors and making your site memorable. Whether it’s a subtle texture or a bold hero image, background images help your design stand out and invite users to explore further. Used thoughtfully, they can make your website feel more alive and engaging.
